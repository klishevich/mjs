// Good authors divide their books into chapters and sections;
// good programmers divide their programs into modules.

// Why use modules?

// 1) Maintainability: By definition, a module is self-contained. 

// 2) Namespacing: In JavaScript, variables outside the scope of a top-level function are global 

// 3) Reusability: Let’s be honest here: we’ve all copied code we previously wrote into new projects at one point or another.
